Roadmap:

Current Features:
- Rockets can be built from almost any block
- Space stations orbiting any planet/moon
- Warpships to take players between said planets
- Planet Selection Guidance
- Basic machinery (to be redone at future date)
- Generates a fixed number of planets in a single solar system
- Fuel Mechanics
- Gas system (O2)
- Satellites
- Data collection of planets (not currently fully featured)
- Support for IC2 and RF
- Planets can be generated from XML
- Gravity generators for space stations
- Stations with day/night cycles
- More Satellites
    - Mining Satellite (ish, is spacestation bound)
    - Energy Collection Satellite
    - Ore Scanning Satallite
- Collection of materials from asteroids
- Asteroids
    - Automated Harvesting
    - Research System
        - Random asteroid parameters ( size, composition, location (polar coords)
        - Research can be done to determine properties

Future Features:
- Other engine types for space ships(ion/plasma)
- Terraforming
- Orbital factories
- Rovers (maybe? planetary exploration?)
- Collection of materials from gas giants
- Docking (maybe..)
- Planetary Mapping System (feasible?)
- More Satellites
    - Weather Control Satellite
    - Mapping satellite (feasible?)
- Clean Rooms
- Research Tree (possible use for planetary data, hire villagers as scientists for you lab!)
- Supports for more power systems
- Remove RF dependance
- Planets actually moving in their orbits
- Railguns to transfer goods between planets and stations
- Stations can be positioned over certain locations on planets
- Colony management system (seed testificates throughout the universe?)
- Config for mapping dims added by other mods to planets
- Gravity generators for local areas on planets
- Ground based telescopes
        - Water Detectors (increases info on %dry) space only
        - Chemical Detectors (increases chance of finding planets rich in certain ores) space only
        - Atmospheric Detectors (increases info on pressure; when combined with chemical can detect if planet has harvestable/hazardous gasses) ground and space
        - Temperature Detector (increases info on planetary temperature) space only
        - Star Scanner (increases the likelyhood of finding planets orbiting a star; higher level allows for smaller planets) ground and Space
- Asteroids
    - Manual Harvesting
    - Research System
        - Player can select as a destination
            - temporary dim in created, destroyed when last player leaves
- Hardmode
    - Must protect space stations from meteors
    - Rockets require life support
    - Space ships require statis chamber and must be provided with food (unless warp) - tranz9999
    - Heat system for machines and plasma engine
