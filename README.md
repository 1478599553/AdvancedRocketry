# AdvancedRocketry
A mod about space, exploration, and resources

MileStones:


Roadmap:

Current Features:
- Rockets can be built from almost any block
- Space stations orbiting any planet/moon
- Warpships to take players between said planets
- planet selection guidance
- Basic machinery (to be redone at future date)
- Generates a fixed number of planets in a single solar system
- fuel mechanics
- Gas system (O2)
- Satellites
- Data collection of planets (not currently fully featured)
- Support for IC2 and RF
- planets can be generated from XML

Future Features:
- Other engine types for space ships(ion/plasma)
- Terraforming
- Orbital factories
- rovers (maybe? need a use)
- collection of materials from gas giants
- collection of materials from asteroids
- docking (maybe..)
- planetary mapping system (feasible?)
- more Satellites
    - mining Satellite
    - Weather control satellite
    - energy collection satellite
    - mapping satellite (feasible?)
    - ore scanning satallite
- clean rooms
- research tree (possible use for planetary data, hire villagers as scientists for you lab!)
- supports for more power systems
- remove RF dependance
- planets actually moving in their orbits
- Railguns to transfer goods between planets and stations
- stations with day/night cycles
- stations can be positioned over certain locations on planets
- colony management system (seed testificates throughout the universe?)
- config for mapping dims added by other mods to planets
- ground based telescopes
        - water detectors (increases info on %dry) space only
        - chemical detectors (increases chance of finding planets rich in certain ores) space only
        - atmospheric detectors (increases info on pressure; when combined with chemical can detect if planet has harvestable/hazardous gasses) ground and space
        - temperature detector (increases info on planetary temperature) space only
        - star scanner (increases the likelyhood of finding planets orbiting a star; higher level allows for smaller planets) ground and space
- Hardmode
    - must protect space stations from meteors
    - rockets require life support
    - space ships require statis chamber and must be provided with food (unless warp) - tranz9999
    - heat system for machines and plasma engine
